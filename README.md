A version of the classic arcade game "Space Invaders" that was originally a DarkGDK game tutorial written in C++. I first started working on this project when I was a freshamn/sophmore in HS, but ran into major issues with pointers, so I translated the original tutorial from C++ to C# while I was transitioning from HS (2010-11). Since then I haven't put much time or effort into the project beacuse life happened to interfere. Now that I've found some more motivation, I'm going to start rebuilding and translating the game so that it runs on any PC (personal computing) platform, but not for mobile devices becasuse that stuff doesn't interest me much. This means I will translating the code base again, this time into Java (my new prefered OOP language). If anyone wants to tinker around with the code base, or make a mobile version, go for it! I'm all about that open source code base, and I expect that any versions of this game remain such. Also, this is meant as a learning project and no one should be using this code base to sell the game for money.

Cheers,
Nate
